I have a set of large PDF documents, around 100 of them. Each documents can range from 20-30 pages to several hundred pages. Pages are mostly text based with some tables. There may be some embedded images as well, but not a lot.
I need to ask all kinds of questions to find information in this set of documents. I need to response to be ACCURATE, COMPLETE and come back fast. I also do NOT want to be cost effective as this is a mostly static set of documents. 
I think RAG is a pretty good solution. but i need to make sure the solution to meet the above requirements. The stack I'm thinking is use LLM assisted chunking with reranking and grounding. I have an OPENAI API key to use. For grounded results, all hits should have references to the sources. 
For MVP, i'd like to be able to index all the files in a given folder using RAG. Pls use a free vector database if you can. I'd also like to query against the documents. Some of the sample questions are "what is the defintion of CSM(client senior manager)?". "who are the CSMs of the company?"
